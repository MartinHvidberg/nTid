Simply initialise text_ctrl_Output to something like "Getting Data
Please Wait", in FillText get your data before clearing the text control
and at the end of __init__ use wx.CallAfter(FillText) to populate your
default list after the GUI is drawn.  You might also like to consider
keeping the data, i.e. assigning it to self.DataList or some such then
you will not need to reread all the files on each display filter change.
